             My name is Victor Yang. I am currently a freshman majoring in Pre-business at UCR.
  I am dorming at East Lothian with my other two roommates, Justin and Joseph. Justin 
 is also majoring in Pre-business, which helps me a lot because I can ask him for help
when I need to. In high school, I played varsity boys golf and competed in parliamentary
debate for two years. I also joined many clubs to expand my social network, such as key
club, FBLA, investment club, Taiwanese Student Association, and hip-hop club. By the end of senior year, 
I have developed social skills as well as communications skills. Joining FBLA was especially beneficial and helpful. 
From there, I explored many business areas, such as finance, marketing, investing, human resource management, accounting, and entrepreneurship. 
I have met many business orientated fellows there and made connections with them.
I have also discovered my interest in finance and investment through my business class. 

    
        <br><br>
        
        
In my business class, my teacher assigned many group projects in which we had to apply business, finance, and marketing knowledge.
However, I've discovered that I am most interested in finance because I am good at numbers and analyzing financial statements. 
In my high school sophomore year, I volunteered to go to Taipei, Taiwan to teach local kids English and develop leadership skills. 
It was an extraordinary experience for me because I found the volunteer experience truly meaningful as I guided the kids to help them explore their passion and goals through English lessons. 
I developed my leadership skill by assigning individual tasks towards my teaching assistants, who were my companions from other high schools. 
I had to keep them in check and make sure that they were doing their jobs and not slacking off. 
Thus, this teaching experience in Taiwan helped me grow mentally as I developed my leadership skill. 
In addition, in my high school senior year, I applied to work at Koja Kitchen, a chained Korean and Japanese fusion food store near my high school. 

        
        
        From there, I acquired many skills such as doing cashier, making food, pouring beer, cleaning tables, communicating with customers, and following orders from my manager and boss. 
        I worked three to four shifts a week. Each shift was about five hours. Although the job was tiring, it was a great working experience for me because I learned that money isnâ€™t easy to make. 
        I learned to budget my expenses as a result of realizing the difficulty of gaining money. I made about 2000-3000 before summer started. I saved most of it into my checking bank account. 
        I spent some of it for my entertainment and desired gifts for myself. From this working experience, I developed diligence, work ethic, ability to follow orders, and the ability to budget. 
        Now that I am in college, I plan to apply for internships that are related to finance. I hope to grow and gain more financial knowledge for my potential career in finance.
        I hope to build on my resume by learning as much as I can in the future.
